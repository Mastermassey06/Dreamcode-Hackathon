# DreamCode-Hackathon
Me and my team, built an application that analyzes and predicts water quality using real-time data from DEFRAâ€™s API.   Our System calculates a water quality score using key metrics like nitrate, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity &amp; more. Machine learning was incorporated to predict future water quality, helping businesses adopt cleaner practices.
